    <h1 style="font-size:60pt;">Distributed Name System &#128187</h1>
    A program called <b>Distributed Name Service (DNS)</b> maps domain names onto IP addresses, keeping the IP addresses "hidden." DNS was an absolute breakthrough in making the Internet accessible to those who were not computer nerds. As a result of its introduction, email addresses became simpler. Previous to DNS, email addresses had all sorts of hideous codes such as exclamation marks, percent signs and other extraneous information to specify the route to the other machine.<br>

    It's interesting that email used to be a long series of numbers and symbols to represent a sender or a receiver. Now with DNS, anyone can have an email address that is short and recognizeable. But sometimes, it's still helpful to have a long address, so it prevents any spam or unwanted tracking. Think of Apple's Hide My Email feature when you create an account in a new app, but don't want companies to access your personal information.<br>
